The integrated web server (port 80/tcp and port 443/tcp) of the affected devices could allow an attacker to inject HTTP headers. An attacker must trick a valid user who is authenticated to the device into clicking on a malicious link to exploit the vulnerability. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known."
